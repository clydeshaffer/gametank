Using a spare soldering iron to weld together top-center, tread-left, and tread-right is recommended.

The center_support model should go between the two circuit boards, with the bump in the cartridge tray facing the rear to prevent accidental reverse cartridge insertion.

The vent piece goes in the rectangular hole near the power entry portion of the bottom board.

badge2.stl is installed in the rectangular opening in front of the cartridge slot by snapping it in from inside, then securing with the soldering iron method.
