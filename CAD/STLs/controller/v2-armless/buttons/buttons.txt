These are designed as keycaps for Cherry MX style keyboard switches.

The caps are designed with a main "cap" part to be 3D printed and a "bushing" piece that is meant to be laser cut from 3mm acrylic.

This two-piece design prevents friction against the surrounding controller shell plastic without having to sand down the sides of each button.

The "A" "B" "C" and "S" caps look particularly good when printed using a multi-material printer and contrasting colors on the recessed letters.
